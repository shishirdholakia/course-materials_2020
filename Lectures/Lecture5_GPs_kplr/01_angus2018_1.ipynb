    "* The disc-integrated flux of a spotted, rotating star often varies in a non-sinusoidal and quasi-periodic (QP) manner, due to active re- gions on its surface that rotate in and out of view. Complicated surface spot patterns produce non-sinusoidal variations, and the finite lifetimes of these active regions and differential rotation on the stellar surface produce quasi-periodicity.\n",

    "* Gaussian processes: very flexible, can be expensive to compute, can deal with multiple (quasi-)periodic processes in the data\n",
    "\n",
    "* In this work, we test an effective model for rotationally modulated stellar light curves that captures the salient behaviour but is not physically motivated – although some parameters may indeed be interpreted as physical ones.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An ideal effective model should have a small number of non-degenerate parameters and be ﬂexible enough to perfectly capture non-sinusoidal and QP behaviour.\n",
    "\n",
    "* They are useful in regression problems involving any stochastic process, speciﬁcally when the probability distribution for the process is a multivariate Gaussian. If the probability of obtaining a data set is a Gaussian in N dimensions, where N is the number of data points, a GP can describe that data set.\n",
    "\n",
    "* An in-depth introduction to GPs is provided in Rasmussen & Williams (2005).\n",

    "\n",
    "<img src=\"img/angus_f1.png\" ></img>\n",
    "\n",
    "* This is a relatively active star that rotates once every ∼30.5 days, with stochastic variability typical of Kepler FGK stars. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Clearly, data points in this light curve are correlated. Points close together in time are tightly correlated, and points more widely separated are loosely correlated. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A GP models this variation in correlation as a function of the separation between data points; that is, it models the covariance structure rather than the data directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This lends GPs their ﬂexibility – they can model any time series with a similar covariance structure. \n",
    "\n",
    "* In addition, a very simple function can usually capture the covariance structure of a light curve, whereas modelling the time series itself might require much more complexity. \n",
    "\n",
    "* A range of covariance models, or kernel functions, can describe stellar variability. For example, the most commonly used kernel function, the ‘squared exponential’ (SE), deﬁned as follows, could adequately ﬁt the KIC 5809890 light curve:\n",

    "\n",

    "\n",
    "* __Problem with the SE kernel__: It does not well describe the covariance in stellar light curves, nor is it useful for the problem of rotation period inference because it does not capture periodic behaviour."
